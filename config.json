  "letterToCongress": "Dear Legislators,\n\nWe are first responders who support strong net neutrality protections. Every day we rely on a range of communications services made possible by the open Internet to help people during emergency situations ranging from automobile accidents to natural disasters.\n\nAccess to reliable, high-quality broadband is essential for our work. We routinely place ourselves in dangerous situations to assist others and save lives. But since the Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules and other key protections in December 2017, the communication services we rely on to do our jobs are no longer meaningfully protected from being arbitrarily slowed, blocked, or otherwise degraded by Internet service providers.\n\nIn response, we are joining with millions of businesses, veterans, and Internet users in asking Congress to use their Congressional Review Act (CRA) powers to restore the strong net neutrality rules and other consumer protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal its 2015 Open Internet Order.\n\nCongress has a responsibility to ensure there is meaningful oversight of our critical communications infrastructure. Please use your CRA powers to restore the protections we lost immediately.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name Here]"
